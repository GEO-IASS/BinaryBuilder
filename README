So here's just some short notes on how to operate this software.

Generally, if you would like Binary Builder to just create everything
on every call you can use the follow commands:

 ./build.py
 ./make-dist.py last-completed-run/install

This will produce a tarball with the completed Stereo Pipeline binaries.

However generally we like to build the dependencies once and than
build are release binaries with every stereo pipeline commit. Here's
how to build the dependencies and an archive tarball.

 ./build.py --dev-env
 ./make-dist.py --include all --set-name BaseSystem last-completed-run/install

Then when you are ready to build VW and ASP:

 ./build.py --base BaseSystem-*.tar.gz visionworkbench stereopipeline
 ./make-dist.py last-completed-run/install

It's pretty likely things will break. This is essentially a fragile
package manager. When things break you'll probably want to keep
calling the build command to see if you fixed the
problem. Traditionally build.py will just build everything, here's how
to rebuild one specific package (that presumibly failed).

 ./build.py --resume gdal

I strongly encourage you to read the output from ./build.py --help and
./make-dist.py --help. There are more features not talked about here.
