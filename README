1. INTRODUCTION

A. Neo-Geography Toolkit

The Neo-Geography Toolkit (NGT) is a collection of tools for automated
processing of geospatial data, including images and maps. It is capable
of processing raw raster data from remote sensing instruments and
transforming it into useful cartographic products, such as visible image
base maps, topographic models, etc. Additionally, components of the NGT
can perform data processing on extremely large geospatial data sets (up
to several tens of terabytes) via parallel processing pipelines.
Finally, it can also transform raw metadata (i.e.  SPICE kernels and PDS
image labels), vector data (e.g., 2D/3D shape files), and geo-tagged
data sets into standard NeoGeography data formats, such as KML.  NGT is
an evolving collection of loosely connected open-source modules designed
by the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group. Modules of the NGT will be
released one at a time, as they reach maturity. To date, we have
completed only one module: the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline, but more will
soon follow. Check this website for the latest updates.

B. Binary Builder

The Binary Builder is a collection of scripts for building the release
binaries for the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP). Binary Builder
downloads and builds all dependencies of ASP including the
dependencies of Vision Workbench and USGS's Integrated Software for
Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS).

Building release binaries is a very difficult and fragile
process. Never can we guarantee that this code works as it will break
on changes made by our dependencies. This code will break on server
URL changes, build system changes, and just generally unsupported
environments. You use this software at your own risk.

3. DOCUMENTATION

A. Produce a Complete Binary Build

If you would like Binary Builder to create a tarball of all Stereo
Pipeline binaries and dependencies, you can use the following
commands:

 ./build.py
 ./make-dist.py last-completed-run/install

It is pretty likely that things will break. This is essentially a
fragile package manager. When things break you'll probably want to
keep calling the build command to see if you fixed the
problem. Traditionally build.py will just build everything, here's how
to rebuild one specific package (that presumably failed):

 ./build.py --resume gdal

We strongly encourage you to read the output from ./build.py --help and
./make-dist.py --help. There are more features not talked about here.

B. Produce a Partial Build or Dev Environment

We usually like to build the dependencies once and then build the
release binaries with every ASP release. Here's how to build the
dependencies as an archive tarball:

 ./build.py --dev-env
 ./make-dist.py --include all --set-name BaseSystem last-completed-run/install

Then, when you are ready to build the ASP release tarballs:

 ./build.py --base BaseSystem-*.tar.bz2 visionworkbench stereopipeline
 ./make-dist.py last-completed-run/install

However, if you just want to call and build VW and ASP yourself so
that you can modify the code, instead of the last two commands use:

 ./deploy-base.py BaseSystem-*.tar.bz2 <INSTALL DIR for 3rd Party software>

Inside the <INSTALL DIR> that you specified you'll find the
appropriate 'bin' and 'lib' directories for all of the used third
party libraries. You will also find example config.option files for VW
and ASP. Copy those files into your respective directories for VW and
ASP. Then you can build VW. Modify the config.options for ASP so that
it points to where VW is.

************************************************************************
4. ADDITIONAL BUILD OPTIONS

The list of packages that were already built is stored in
<build-root>/done.txt (default: ./build_asp/done.txt). On each line is
the package name and the hash tag for that package. To force a package
to be rebuilt, remove its entry from the list. A package will be
rebuilt in either case if the hash tag changes.

To avoid building a package even if it was not built yet, invoke
build.py with the option _<package name>, i.e., ./build.py _isis.

5. CREDITS

The NGT was developed within the Autonomous Systems and
Robotics area of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames
Research Center.  It leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's (IRG)
extensive experience developing surface reconstruction and tools for
planetary exploration---e.g. the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration
Rover missions---and rover autonomy.  It has also been developed in
collaboration with the Adaptive Control and Evolvable Systems (ACES)
group, and draws on their experience developing computer vision
techniques for autonomous vehicle control systems.
